Adopt-A-Dog is similar to sites like petfinder.com, but it is focused on finding dogs for adoption in the Seattle area. With its user interface, you can select a dog, quickly get its breed, price, and name, and adopt it through a simple checkout form.

I wrote Adopt-A-Dog with JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and jQuery. It runs on all major browsers, including Safari and Chrome for mobile and desktop, Firefox and Microsoft Edge. Its CSS grid relies mostly on flexbox to make it responsive to different monitor sizes.

In the future I plan to add more backend infrastructure so that users can sign in and save their searches and purchases and their cart isn't deleted each time they refresh the page.
